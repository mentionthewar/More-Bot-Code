'Bonus' bot code

The random-who code shows how to output text as an image (it uses a font and a sample image which are not included) and also shows randomisation of collections of lists.

The other file shows a few basic api calls including calling mentions. To do conversation we need to handle these mentions in some way and be able to respond (tweet) based on what they say.
